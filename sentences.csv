Kids in cages! Sleeping on concrete floors with aluminum blankets! No access to simple dignities! How is this still happening??? It’s absolutely inhumane to treat anyone like this let alone children.

"Yesterday at the Empowerment in Entertainment event, I had the honor to meet some of the brightest students who might never have imagined a career in Hollywood as they were given the opportunity to go to college and work with mentors in the industry. Thank you to the most courageous, brave, intellectual, strong, beautiful spirit that is Oprah for caring so much about empowering all walks of life but more importantly for being the action and not just standing behind the word. You DO it. Thank you for continually inspiring us to be kinder, greater and stretching all the boundaries for the better. “From everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required.” "
"I met Theresa 5 years ago. We worked together and became best friends. She has taught me how to see life in a fun, carefree and uplifting way. She has shown me how to be a strong and fearless woman. She is beautiful, kind and smart. I saw how capable she was of achieving her dreams. I wanted nothing more than to see her pursue them and soar. And here you are making it happen T.

My sweet soul sister. Julia you have been a huge part of my life. You have taught me how to have courage when I have self doubt. This song is extremely close to my heart as I’ve experienced anxiety and know a lot of my friends do too. You’re never alone if you feel this way. The message is much needed and I really hope you guys like it!

"It’s been awhile since you have heard from me, but I wanted to wish everyone a happy new year and to thank you for your love and support. Last year was definitely a year of self-reflection, challenges and growth. It’s always those challenges which show you who you are and what you are capable of overcoming. Trust me, it’s not easy, but I am proud of the person I am becoming and look forward to the year ahead. Love you all. "
"Mood lol (I was looking at myself in the mirror -like an idiot!) Update: taking a social media break. Again. As much as I am grateful for the voice that social media gives each of us, I am equally grateful to be able to step back and live my life present to the moment I have been given. Kindness and encouragement only for a bit! Just remember- negative comments can hurt anybody’s feelings. Obvi. "

"Alright. Speaking from my heart for over an hour to someone who puts those thoughts into paid words can be hard for me. The older I get the more I want my voice to be mine. This is all apart of my work within an industry that’s been around longer than all of us have been. The purpose of my interview was three fold. My work with A21, my new collection with Coach, and some new music. As I’m aware there will always be interests in one’s personal life because that’s the pace of our ‘social’ generation. I’m grateful for my position and I will always find ways to make my job more about others and giving back— all while having the best time with my music, fashion, film and my love for learning about the world that I’m eager to tap into more and more. Church is a name for something far more personal. There’s always agenda seeking information on such a subject and I understand why. Rarely do I mention church (and I didn’t) but I’ll always feel comfortable talking about my values and beliefs. I respect that from everyone and anyone. I understand that reporters are working to grab the attention of a reader, however I will always work to ensure that what is public represents my truth. I’m a bit bummed but rarely surprised. Y’all know me and my heart. I can’t help it. So I’ll post some of MY photos from the collection and work with A21. My heart. And maybe edit my actual lyrics as you will all hear it soon 😊 I love you guys to the moon and back. For more information on the work I do with A21 please, please visit link in my bio. So much more on that soon! "

"I’m very aware some of my fans had noticed I was laying low for part of the summer and questioning why I wasn’t promoting my new music, which I was extremely proud of. So I found out I needed to get a kidney transplant due to my Lupus and was recovering. It was what I needed to do for my overall health. I honestly look forward to sharing with you, soon my journey through these past several months as I have always wanted to do with you. Until then I want to publicly thank my family and incredible team of doctors for everything they have done for me prior to and post-surgery. And finally, there aren’t words to describe how I can possibly thank my beautiful friend Francia Raisa. She gave me the ultimate gift and sacrifice by donating her kidney to me. I am incredibly blessed. I love you so much sis. Lupus continues to be very misunderstood but progress is being made. For more information regarding Lupus please go to the Lupus Research Alliance website: www.lupusresearch.org/ -by grace through faith "
"Sometimes it's incredibly difficult to wake up every day knowing there is so much going on in the world. At times I feel selfish, I ask why, I ask how can this change? Will it actually ever change? I try to contribute my heart before anything because it can be so easy to lose the desire to have hope when sometimes all I want to be is angry. When I read about the beautiful women who wake up consciously every day to make a change, it inspires me to want to do so much more. Not really sure how I got so lucky but thank you for highlighting the power of what we can and will always strive to be. I believe in the goodness in the land of the living. I hope this is just the beginning of more change. "

Whether you have read this book or not, it's a story of what every kid does and will continue to go through - unless we keep talking about it. People are hurting and deserve to be heard. Tired of others portraying a false idea of what every day life is. I hope can enlighten people to what words mean when you say them. "

"MY NINE MOST IMPACTFUL MOMENTS OF 2019 1.) when i pulled my hamstring twice and started turning into thanos... then raged my face off in Ibiza for two weeks and made it 10x worse. - 2.) the passing of a young legend. Kong Da Savage was kidnapped & eaten by a coyote. This was the last pic we ever took. He was so soft & so dumb & he’ll always hold a special spot in my heart. If you’re a coyote and you’re reading this, im coming for you 🏹 - 3.) adoption of a new legend, the world’s greatest looking husky. I try to emulate this dog’s energy. He’s always happy, ready for adventure, and eager to please. My new best friend. - 4.) when i slapped a man into the 8th dimension & realized i DIDNT want to fly to Russia and enter the International Russian Slapping Contest. May seem obvious but this was a big growth moment for me in realizing that Life > Content. - 5.) When we trolled the entire world & infiltrated the flat earth community under the guise that I, Pogan Laul, believe the earth is flat. Don’t be f**king morons. - 6.) the death of the most iconic bird in history: This little sun conure was my GUY since high school, before Vine. He was eaten by who is currently at Bad Dog Camp. Maverick became a martyr as he continues to emblazon apparel on people across the world. - 7.) extending our family at the Watts Empowerment Center. We brought a Winter Wonderland to kids in California who have never seen snow. I love these hooligans. - 8.) We’ve been saying it, but the world finally caught up... was awarded “Podcast of The Year” at the 2019 awards. Holy sh*t this show has changed my life & people’s perception of me. - 9.) THE FIGHT... after becoming a professional boxer & three months of a grueling fight camp, I unfortunately came up short. Sort of. We sold out the Staples Center, made internet history AGAIN, & became one of the most successful boxing events on I’ll likely have two fights next year, 1 MMA and 1 Boxing. - Final notes: I didn’t suck that dick (sorry?) Team Maverick is doing 2020 sober 2020 is the year of the girlfriend Two points was bullsh*t "

"i hate this post so much and i hate that i have to do this but i believe i owe it to y’all after the years of continuous and relentless support... the iconic has died. After being with me every day for 7 years, since before I even started Vine, Maverick passed while I was away in Sweden. And by passed, I mean, he was eaten by my Mastiff, who mistook him for a small rubber chicken. This little bird inspired so much of what I do, he was my best friend, he’s the inspiration behind the icon worn proudly by millions of people around the world, and as bizarre as it sounds, this little parrot’s legacy will live on FAR beyond his life. I’m not sure where to go from here or how to handle this because it’s symbolic to me in so many ways, but for all the Mavericks out there who continue to see life through the lens of possibility, who continue to persevere and embrace their differences, I have never-ending love and optimism for you. Maverick will always be with us in spirit, and he will forever hold the largest piece of my heart. Stay strong & I will too "

WHYYYY?!” <— lol can you imagine that? ANYWAYS... I took the loss. But I decided to say F**K IT, and that I wasn’t going to let this road bump shape my destiny or my mindset.

"ya boy scored the cover of 😉 recently I've come to the realization that my life is a whirlwind of ""I don't know wtf is going on, but I'm just gonna go ahead and LIVE."" By this I mean... I'm a kid from a small suburb outside of Cleveland, Ohio. Never in my life would I have expected to make the cover of one of the biggest print advertising magazines in the world Or star in a feature film Or write and create my own feature film (details coming soon 😉)... Or, MY FAVORITE, build an audience, a fanbase, a SQUAD of 22M+ people across all my social networks. NOW, I'm not saying this cover is the end-all-be-all, but I could NOT have done this without all of your support and love these past two years. All of you. This is a nice rung in the ladder and I'm super incredibly unbelievably fortunate that you guys want to climb it with me :) WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS... Throughout all the madness, I stopped trying to comprehend it and decided to go back to the basics - Stay humble, stay crazy, and most importantly: stay driven. Okay. I'm done. Back to entertaining.

"I’m proud of myself, my heart, and my strength. growing up in the light with a million eyes on you just isn’t normal. I’ve lost friends along the way and I’ve lost myself too sometimes. my first tattoo was “sanity” to remind myself everyday to keep it. I’ve struggled with anxiety my whole young adult life and after my baby i dealt with all the internal ups and downs. I felt like i had to find myself completely again. I keep a whole lot to myself but just wanted to share and let you know I’m human. my life is not perfect and what you see here on social media is just the surface. be gentle with yourself, move on, and let go. we are all capable of great things, worthy of love, and allowed to express ourselves. do more of what makes you happy and be unapologetic. now is your season ✨ we all have a magnificent destiny.

"Ugh Instagram if it's not broke don't fix it! Instagram is changing out of chronological order 😔 so let's say you love someone's photos but don't physically ""like"" their pics they will bump them to the bottom. It's called INSTAgram for a reason. I don't really understand it and there has to be another motive because you follow people for a reason.. I'm trying to see everyone's pics. That's why you created the unfollow button if u don't want to see their photos. I hate this new update is slowly trying to introduce & yes it's true they warned us all a few weeks ago. "
you know me you know I love my .. Gives you that extra boost to stay fit & feel good 🙏🏻

"I LOVE THIS! Please read this. small people will always bring you down. ""I got to spend these last 2 days doing nothing but therapy appointments. After speaking to a middle school today one of the girls asked me doesn't it make you really tired? My answer was no actually the quite opposite. What gets tiring is sitting all day. Not moving and being in one spot, that makes you tired. When I leave therapy after a couple hours of giving it all I got, I feel more alive than anything. I thank God for these appointments and pieces of equipment and hands on deck that move my body. You know, as I sit here and think to myself, I want to encourage you to just try and be grateful for even all the little things. To try and think of all the small things that have carried you through. To enjoy all of the moments. To find those things, whether few or many, that give you a sense of purpose. It's different for all of us. And isn't that the coolest part? That we are all so different yet searching for the same thing? It blows my mind. Don't let people bring you down, small people do that. Find those ones that want to lift you up, those that want to carry you on their journey of success. So you too can carry people on yours. Whether it's a mistake, tragedy, loss, or just life running it's course that has brought you to the here and now, I hope you can find peace in your current circumstance. I hope you go to bed tonight and wake up tomorrow morning ready to attack the day with enthusiasm. Even if it carries grief, let that grief fuel your greatness ✨ past mistakes | paralyzed"" "
I wish I could've been as confident as you are. You are super inspiring to me. the scars on my face. I have been bullied my entire life because of them. I was born different and that doesn't matter to me anymore. I'm proud of who I am and there is no shame of it.

"Growth & positivity ❤️ ""2016 will be the year of positivity....starting with body positivity 💪🏽 I used to see myself filled with flaws and I never really understood the good within me. For example, I always hated my smile. I never had perfect teeth and my jaw is slightly cricked. Or how I am embedded with acne scars on my face and back. Or how I saw myself entirely in the mirror. Compared to what I've seen on social media, I never felt real. Or the countless other reasons. We are truly our worst critics. But I feel the older I am, the more I start to grow and the more comfortable I become in my own skin. So let this year be another year of growth and positivity. what I see. "

"Wow this story! Thank you ""The first photo was taken when I was at my lowest weight, 69lbs. The photo next to it is one of my recent photo shoots. I'm Christina. I've been blessed with incredibly supportive friends and family. Lately, things have been amazing. But there's been multiple times where things haven't been. I was born with congenial pulmonary lymph angestia; a rare lung condition that at the time of my diagnosis, there were 20 people in my state that had ever had it. At the time of my diagnosis, the disease had a 97% morality rate in infants. I weighed 3 pounds and 6 ounces. My lungs weren't fully developed and they were filled with mucus. I was in the ICU for about six months before I was able to go home. At home, I had a heart monitor for my younger years, as well as frequent hospital trips caused by extreme difficulty breathing and physical developmental issues. When I was 16 until I was 19, I had to drop out of high school and become homeschooled because I got so sick. I couldn't keep food down (the mucus in my stomach was affected as well, which we didn't know about.), I couldn't breathe, and I was 69lbs. I was so depressed and suicidal because I felt so terrible constantly. Waking up was hell. I was on about eight medications and eventually had toxic shock from all the medicine. Eventually, they found out that digestive enzymes helped and a treatment that finally started working for me. At my lowest points, I was heavily involved in self harm. I have post traumatic stress disorder from my time in and out of the hospital. I have nightmares about being in there. I lost a lot of my friends and my self confidence plummeted. I couldn't look in the mirror without crying, and truly thought that I would be better off dead and that people would be happier without such a lieability. The depression and anxiety still fights me. I'm not always put together. And my disease flares up, a lot, usually at inconvient times. But my illness and my past. We are all more than what we seem. Everyone has their struggles, so be mindful and be kind"" "
"I think you're pretty cool 😋 ""Let's try this one more time as I am only sharing this so people like me or parents who have kids like me no they are not alone and so they can see how it truly is out there ... Walk with my Head Held High even tho these words are stuck to my Heart ! A lot of people may not understand my message but it's the way I see Life : As much as I walk with my head held high all the time I am only human and can only take so much. Being Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual , Transgender in this world isn't the easiest thing at all . We are often bullied , killed , or even pressured into killing ourselves ""suicide"". I try to never let these words get to me but trust me these hurt and sink into your heart more then I think getting beat up . I try to not let it bother me but at the end of the day I sometimes just crawl up my bed and cry my eyes out and asking God for this world to be a much better , understanding and Safe place . Love Has no Gender we are all entitled to our own opinions but if your opinion is going to hurt someone's Soul please keep it to yourself , I beg of you . Faggot you see at the club the Queer at the Mall the Joto at the Restaurant , the Homo at the Gym , the Tranny that you say is trying to hard in life and will never be a woman .... ""thing"" you make fun of on Social Media "
"I look at stories all day that inspire and encourage me. is a way to share these stories with you guys in hopes that it could help you too. Bullying other people is not the answer. Be kind to everybody. You are the dopest for this thanks for sharing.... ""This is 100% me. No filter, no photoshop, no caked on makeup. Just my natural, covered in scars, self. The most pure form of beauty. And I'm happy with it. 😌 As long as I think I'm beautiful, nothing or anyone else's opinion matters. "

my lady friends for life
"a victim of rape. I'm a survivor. This is my story. With domestic violence being such a big issue in Australia at the moment. I thought I would share my story in hope that it will inspire at least one person to get help. I was with my ex partner for just over a year, things were great..at the start. Until he got addicted and started to rely heavily on the drug crystal meth. That's when things started to get abusive and extremely violent and I started to lie to my friends that I wasn't seeing him, because they knew how abusive he was. I had to cover marks and bruises with make up. I refused to believe that he was an unstable person, and believed that I could change him, but I couldn't. One day we went out to a club and he drugged me, I woke up tied to a bed and was gang raped by him and 7 other people. He made me believe that I deserved the abuse and I would take it. Towards the end of the relationship he called me telling me to go to his house because there was some type of emergency. I went and found him having sexual intercourse with another male. That should have been the end of it right? Though a couple weeks later he texted me saying to meet me at his house because he wanted to apologise for everything that he did..stupidly I went, as soon as I arrived he grabbed the back of my head and smashed it into a brick wall, whilst choking me he forced himself on me. I didn't tell my parents about the abuse until about a year later, and told my friends that I managed to get him off me because that's what I wanted to believe. Though no one should be ashamed of domestic violence and rape. It's never your fault and you should always speak up and help is out there. If you have experienced and are going through something similar, please don't hesitate to seek help. If you would like support and someone to talk to don't hesitate to call BeyondBlue support service on 1300 22 46 36. If you are in an emergency call 000 straight away and ask for police. Never think your alone and help isn't available. Your not a victim your a survivor. depression, anxiety, PTSD. "

"Proud of you too ❤️ my weight. From my freshman year of high school to my junior year, I went from being a healthy 5'6"" and 120 pounds to being 80 pounds. I was struggling through my parents divorce and a really bad breakup. It led to anorexia which was one of the hardest things in my life to overcome so far. I was so skinny, if I laid down, you could see and feel my organs in my stomach. At the same time I was dealing with so much anxiety and depression that I could not even think straight. I hope no one ever has to go through the same struggles as myself. Because of my anorexia my family became concerned for me and instead of them trying to find help for me, they just pointed out my obvious weight loss to the point where I would feel even worse about myself. All these issues caused me to become extremely ill by my junior year and I was hospitalized 4 or 5 times that year do to malnutrition. Something snapped in me by the end of my junior year to the point where I just had to change myself or my life was going to go down the drain. I have gained my weight back to 120, but now I have to go through the struggle of people pointing out my weight gain, they are mostly good comments, but I still struggle at seeing myself at the weight I want to be. I look at pictures of myself from 4 years ago and say ""man I was skinny then"" and then I have to remind myself, no I was unhealthy. Trying to see myself as healthy is hard, but I am thankful for my friends who helped me out of the bad place I was in. I hope this helps others who are struggling with similar issues as mine."" "

"Thank you for your words my wheelchair 👸🏻🔥🔥 I have been doing really great lately and I thought it was time to share my piece of mind with you guys. 2015 has been one hell of a ride, and I am proud of me ; worked so far with amazing people, kept drawing when I couldn't for months because of the car accident I had last year, and also graduated. I left my comfort zone many, many times this year and I kept going, my faith in brighter days never faltering. Being different physically is complicated, you have to deal with loads of shits, and still keep smiling. I want to say to anyone who feels different, lonely or just down, You never know what tomorrow is made of, in good or bad, so please, keep going and Life is weird, so are we, and that's what is I decided to embrace my flaws a long time ago, and I never regretted once that decision. I'm a young artist, and once again here, it's hard being different because, judgments (""you can draw with your hands?"") but it's worth it. I believe one day, I will work for making her cds covers, and even make exhibitions in San Fran, Amsterdam and Tokyo. In meantime I'm gonna build my empire, one drawing per day. And because life is worth living no matter what. I love life. Do "

"hello pretty I love your story. ""Hey my new gorgeous babes and those who has been there with me since day 1. I just wanted to share you my story for those who doesn't know what I have! - I have a hairloss which is called Alopecia is a Hair Loss, my immune system kills my hair follicles which makes me lose my hair on my body. Ive had it since I was one years old! So it's been basically my whole life that I've had it. I remember in kindergarten I'd get bullied for wearing a hat a lot and getting teased thru elementary as that girl who was bald. It really hurt me that people everywhere would look at me differently. Thru out the years I've gained confidence slowly. I started wearing a wig in 6th grade til Junior year of high school. - I decided to start a Instagram the beginning of my junior year of high school, towards the end of junior year I've gained so much confidence to go to school without my wig, Trust me guys I was so scared to face my biggest fear. But guess what! it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Everyone supported me and accepted me for who I am. On social media I had the best supporters ever! To support me and make me happy!! I don't even know what'd I do without you guys and my family and friends. Just a thank you guys for being apart of my life. I'm so grateful to make you guys happy with my positive thoughts and my YouTube videos 💜 I hope my story tells you that you shouldn't hide who you really are! You must embrace your flaws, just be yourself, and be happy!! I just want to change the world to make it a better place, and to make you all happy💜 just a girl who was looked differently. I love you guys 😘 (ps. Your smile could make another persons day)"" "

"This is so inspiring and you are so amazing. ""If this never gets seen by then that is okay because I know some what, it will inspire and help someone that reads it. It is estimated that in Australia alone 45% of the popular with experience a mental health continue through their life. Twice as many young people die from suicide then road accidents. For years and years I suffered with clinical depression. Dropping out of school in year 9 and being in and out of hospital for over 10 months. The demons were real and at the time I really did not want to be alive. I never thought it was possible to be happy again, or leave the small country town I was at. I was failing at school and for years my anxiety and depression ruled my life, how I felt. Who I spoke to, my eating habits, the way I saw my self, how I saw others. It consumed me in every possible way. You have got to find what you love in life and I cannot stress that enough. Since leaving dungog and moving to live on the lake with Lawrence for the last 2 years I have been off medication and absolutely loving and thriving of life! Every day is a blessing. Since starting 8 months ago, I am a changed person. I smile, I love life. I want YOU to know you are more then what your depression tells you, you are worth more then a blade to your skin, you are beautiful and you deserve to be in this world, other wise you would not of been born. Find your passion and your mission and infuse them both into your daily work, let your determination drip from you. I hope can notice this, and share this as I know more then half her followers would of or would be suffering from depression. And together we might just save a few life's! "

"Beautiful Johnny ""So I'm gonna share my burn story :D so the reason I look like this, is a pretty long story, hopefully Instagram will give me enough room to type it xD okay well here. November 20th 2003 I was playing in the backyard with my sister Joanna. We had this hay loft fort we made in the shed. And we had no flash lights, so we got a candle & match, brought it into the shed so we could have some light. So my sister leaves to use the bathroom or whatever, and I climb to the top of the fort. I call Max our dog, and he comes running in the shed, jumps on the loft the candle was on. And it falls over. By the time Max got to my lap, I was already surrounded by fire. My sister comes out and screams at me to jump. But I'm too scared because it's too high, and there was fire below me. So Joanna (age 7) comes running to get our older sister Leah in the house, who was baby sitting us, but was doing homework with my brother Luke at the time. So Joanna screams at Leah (older sister) JOHNS TRAPPED IN THE FIREY SHED AND CANT GET OUT! So Leah runs outside. She was holding her baby, so she put her baby on the ground and asks Joanna where I am. So Leah holds her breath and shuts her eyes, and runs in the fire, she can't find me so she runs back out. Takes another's deep breath etc, she finds me, but she doesn't know why I'm so heavy. It's because max was on me. So she pulled me off the fort outside. I'm not breathing, and Leah screams please God let him breathe! I gasp for breath, I'm brought to le bonhuar (sorry can't spell that hospital xD) they say I only have 8 hours to live. But then Shriners hospital came, took me in a helicopter to Galveston TX.then put me in a coma for 6 months or something like that lol okay well my past, I look at this accident as blessing, because if it never happened, I wouldn't be the strong confidant person I am today. Oh yeah there was way more emotional healing than physical. But I pulled through :D ^^ so ya burnsurvivor awareness must be spread :3 "

"""I wanted to do this for so long now and share my story to my followers and give back the love ✌🏻️ and the hashtag with encouraged me to share. So , at 3 months old i was given up for fostering due to my birth mother having addiction problems during her pregnancy with me. I was fostered for about 6 months and then adopted at 8 months . Growing up was hard for me because as a young boy in primary school trying to explain why i had two family trees and two ""tummy mummies"" was tough as i myself didn't really understand what that meant. After many awkward and tough encounters with family members I decided to tell one of my closet friends my story. This was when i was entering high school. This person decided to tell others my story and this destroyed me. Everyone knew and was bothering me and teasing me and I felt so isolated. This led to years of bullying and trying to hide myself ,me being insecure and angry . I used to get so angry and confused and just wanted to be normal . So frustrated with the concept of trying to blend in. I was obsessed with the idea of being normal and this led to me retreating into myself , building walls in my friendships so i didn't get hurt so easily . Adoption is such an amazing thing and personally I feel like there isnt enough publicity for me and my fellow peers that are adopted . THIS IS THE REASON IM DOING THIS . I want people that are adopted to know I UNDERSTAND YOU AND ITS OKAY! . Recently ive learned that what others tell me i am. And that my insecurities and my struggles. I am so blessed to have this life I live and have realised that God has got my life all planned out. I want to just say BE YOU , don't live for anyone else. Be happy, be confident and love yourself. Thank you for reading 📋✨"" Thank you for sharing this very inspirational and beautiful. "

"Avery Ford I'm an entrepreneur and filmmaker in Kansas City, Missouri and you see. I was born with a condition in which one or both eyes is not properly aligned. I am also blind in my left eye. I went through most of my life feeling ashamed of how I looked. It wasn't until my late twenties that I learned to love myself just as I am. No one is perfect. We all have things that we would like to change about ourselves, but remember this- because you are here, you are worthy of love, happiness and human dignity. There isn't anything you need to do to earn your worthiness. It is your birthright. For so many years, I felt like I had to work a little harder to get people to see past my condition and connect to the real me. Now I see that this was never true. People have always seen the real me when I dared to show up and be present. What I know for sure is this: people see you too. Even when you feel invisible. Even when life knocks you down. If I can make peace with how I look, you can make peace with your insecurities. The world is waiting for you to show up in all of your glory. Will you answer the call? Hear more of my story at www.averyford.com thank you for your post :) "

"- I’m obsessed with Em Ford She’s a retired model and a current beauty blogger who does dope makeup. She recently revealed on that underneath her makeup she has severe acne. “I never had acne when I was a teenager and then at the end of 2014 it just happened. That’s the crazy thing about acne… it doesn’t discriminate on who you are (old, young, black, white, rich, poor)"". Her posts of her makeupless selfies resulted in over 100,000 crazy negative comments on her pictures. Em made a very powerful video highlighting the negative comments she received on her social media after the makeupless selfies. The video racked up 8 million views in the first week and has now been viewed over 15 million times. Em’s biggest advice was to “make friends with the person you see in the mirror because that will change your life. It’s really difficult to do and it’s going to take longer than 2 or 3 days… but once you do it will change your life.” Check out Em’s Instagram - she’s proving to the haters that my acne. "

"- At 13 years old, Gigi Crouch was diagnosed with Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis and prescribed years in a brace. Gigi had just begun intensive ballet training and this diagnosis could have really hindered her desire and motivation to succeed in the world of dance. “Just being comfortable in the brace was really hard to get used to. It was made out of hard plastic. In the beginning I had to wear it 18-20 hours a day which cut into my ballet training.” However, Gigi realized quickly that her condition could be an advantage instead of handicap. She currently studies at in their professional division, just like one of her favorite ballerinas who recently retired. She also got to study at the School of American Ballet summer program in NYC. Gigi said that the best thing she did was “finding people that were going through the same thing as her.” She even learned about the ballerina Wendy Whelan who also suffers from Scoliosis. “There is a great support group curvygirlsscoliosis.com that connects you with people in your state, your nation or the world who have scoliosis so you can share your story and hear others.” Check out Gigi’s instagram - she’s showing her doubters that my scoliosis! Gigi is amazing. "

"- I'm getting a little more personal... When Lizzie Velasquez was 17 years old, someone posted a video of her on YouTube calling her the world’s ugliest woman. “By the time I saw the video, it had 4 million views.” Now 26 years old, Lizzie’s condition was diagnosed last summer. Lizzie suffers from a rare congenital disease that less than 10 people in the world are known to have. The disease impedes her from accumulating body fat; she literally has zero percent body fat and has never weighed more than 64 pounds, however though it is not terminal. Throughout her entire life, this condition has resulted in a lot of It is so unacceptable to treat people like this. People are so quick to say horrible things about me everyday over and over and sometimes I can't take it. Even I at times get affected by it, I breakdown, I hide, I cry. It's resulted in a lot of anxiety for me that I've never had to deal with before ever. My every move has been documented for the whole world and its been a nightmare trying to find myself through all of this. And I've absolutely lost apart of myself. Lizzie, you are so strong and I admire you so so much. Lizzie has taken that negative energy and has turned it around by traveling around the world doing motivational speeches. When I asked her what the key messages were of her speeches, she told me that “Most importantly I try to convey that all you need to have is a brave heart to accomplish whatever you want to achieve. Let the negative build you up instead of knocking you down. You are enough no matter what; you were put on this earth for a reason” Soon you’ll be able to see her story on the big screen in the documentary film in theaters on September 25th. Check out Lizzie’s Instagram - she’s taking a lifetime full of bullying to help teach the world the names they call me. and Lizzie taught me who I think I am. For me, this is expected it comes with the territory. But Lizzie, you should of not had to go through that. Let's change this together. I love you Lizzie! I'll see you soon. "

Anthony came out to Jacob early on in their friendship. “It was very casual,” Anthony said when I asked if he remembered coming out to Jacob. “The most important thing I remember was how loving and accepting Jacob made me feel.” When it came time for their junior year, both Jacob and Anthony were so excited to go to prom until things starting going wrong in their personal life. “My girlfriend and I had just broken up,” Jacob mentioned and he was just going to go with friends until he saw Anthony’s tweets. “I realized that helping him with something that would make him happy would also make me happy… and it would probably be the best way to go to prom.” even helped them find the perfect outfit by sending them to to find suits. They had the best time at the prom and have inspired not only their community but the world. They even appeared on the ! The most important thing they want people to know and remember is that “YOU matter and people care about YOU.

Her cover of got attention from outlets ranging from to Erica’s is really inspiring because of her extremely body-positive, beautiful photos she posts of herself.

A lot of people will come and go in your life but they can never do as much for you as you can do for yourself.” Check out Erica’s Instagram - she’s teaching us all the titles they give me.

"- Renee DuShane a 21 year old college student who was born with Renee described it as “a genetic disorder where the bones in my face don’t really know how to fuse correctly so part of my jaw is really small. I had to have surgery when I was born so that my brain could grow.” Renee is so strong willed and a super intelligent girl who told me that while growing up she never had many issues with bullying. ""I went to school with all the same kids all the way through high school. Right around senior year, I started getting very anxious about having to explain my condition to all of the new people I would meet in college. I started going on Tumblr and saw lots of profiles of positive, confident people” that inspired her to start sharing her photos even with her insecurities. “It’s so hard to keep myself from responding to the negative comments,” she told me. “Even harder is keeping my friends from getting angry.” It's so important to have a great group of friends. Renee also told me about the tattoo she recently got of her life motto: Stay Strong, Always Love. “Loving is always going to be a better place than hating,” she shared. Check out Renee’s Instagram - she’s showing the world my forehead. I love you Renee! She is so awesome & inspiring. Renee taught ME that the negative comments that I read. "

Getting silly in interviews with
Lace & Loubs
"At this age, everything is changing. Day by day we don't notice, but just look back over the past year and you will realize everything has. People you thought were going to be there forever aren't, and people you never imagined you'd be speaking to are now some of your closet friends. Life makes little sense, and the more we grow the less sense it makes. So make the most of it now, before it all changes once again, because in the near future, all of this is going to be just a memory. "

"As we grow up, we learn that even the one person that wasn't supposed to ever let you down probably will. You will have your heart broken probably more than once and it's harder every time. You'll break hearts too, so remember how it felt when yours was broken. You'll fight with your best friend. You'll blame a new love for things an old one did. You'll cry because time is passing too fast, and you'll eventually lose someone you love. So take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like you've never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute of happiness you'll never get back. "

"Today, I had the honor of meeting in person and the privilege of sitting with him when he got the news that the highest court in Texas had issued a stay of execution and remanded the case back to the trial court for further consideration. Words cannot describe the relief and hope that swept over the room in that moment. That hope had been building over the last few weeks around Rodney’s case. We have seen Democrats and Republicans come together. We have seen grassroots activists and lawmakers link arms. We have heard people all around the globe speak up. And all because of a deep belief that every man or woman accused of a crime - especially one punishable by death - deserves the chance to have all available evidence considered. So grateful for the commitment and passion of everyone who voiced their support, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles for their recommendation to issue a 120 day reprieve, and the courts for issuing a stay!

These are the original pieces we’re bringing back on November 20th, which will feature a super soft fabric SKIMS label!

I’ve watched him grow from a talented young artist who slowly and respectfully worked his way up through the years in the the old fashioned way, never expecting short cuts and always putting his work and others first. He values hard work and is loyal to the core. Never one to follow trends, he’s become a trailblazer, pioneer, educator and an inspiration to artists around the world. I’m so excited I can finally announce our 2nd collaboration together. I’ve watched him work passionately for the past year on this collection and campaign (and he’s also driven us all crazy!) in his quest for perfection. Stay tuned for round 2 of KKW x MARIO: The Artist And Muse ♥️ You guys are going to love this collection!!! "

"Today we celebrate my mom. Anyone that knows her, knows how sentimental she is. For her birthday I planned a small lunch, with just her kids and her closest friends of 40 + years. I sent out invites with a location where we all met. When everyone arrived, I told them I had a surprise and this wasn’t where we would be eating. I then gave everyone the REAL invitation and once everyone saw the address for where we would be going tears filled the room. I rented our childhood home. All of our memories live here especially with our dad. It’s where each Kardashian child was born and made us who we are. Growing up, the home had the most ridiculous wallpaper and kitchen set! I remade all of our table settings, decor out of the same fabric and print as the wallpaper. We had lunch at the home as if it hadn’t changed and we cried the entire time. When we walked out to get our cars to drive there, I had another surprise! I had rented every car my parents ever owned. I had some waiting outside so we could drive them to the house and the rest were lined up in the driveway of the house exactly how my parents used to have them parked. I even remade the exact license plates. (Yes my mom had a 2 DIE 4 license plate!) We drove to the home in these cars and relived our childhood! This was the best day ever. I am so proud I was able to keep such a meaningful surprise a secret from my mom and sisters for weeks! This was the most special, nostalgic day of my life and we felt my dad’s presence enjoying this day with us! I kept it together and didn’t cry the entire lunch even though I cried during the entire planning process. But at the end I went into my old bathroom, closed the door and cried so hard. "
"Happy Birthday mama!!!! Today is your day! You are the best mom in the entire world. I don’t know how you do it! Seriously my love and respect for you grows every single day seeing how you manage to take care of 6 kids, a million grand kids and make everyone feel so loved and special. You’ve given us the tools to be the best we can be and have taught us that kindness rules the world! I can’t wait to celebrate you today! I love you so much! "

It was the 5 year anniversary of Kim Kardashian Hollywood yesterday! I just have to say a huge thank you to everyone who plays the game! 5 years and still going so strong is record breaking. My character got Muglarized! Who wants to see all of my Mugler looks in the game?!?!?!
"Finally I can share with you guys this project that I have been developing for the last year. I’ve been passionate about this for 15 years. Kimono is my take on shapewear and solutions for women that actually work. I would always cut up my shapewear to make my own styles, and there have also been so many times I couldn’t find a shapeware color that blended with my skin tone so we needed a solution for all of this.

"Since the passage of the First Step Act in December, I’ve been speaking with people coming home from prison and learning about the challenges they are facing. While I have been able to offer support to some of the individuals I have met, the obstacles to success are an everyday struggle for thousands and more needs to be done. It was an honor to take part in the announcement that the administration and private sector will be stepping up to create opportunities for these men and women to succeed once home. I’m proud to partner on this initiative with , a company with a history of taking bold action to do what’s right for our community. Thank you for providing ride share credits to formally incarcerated people when they come home. If there are any other companies who would like to step up, we would welcome the support. At the moment we have a particular need for cell phones and minutes so that these people can communicate with potential employers and with their loved ones. "

"My grandma MJ asked me about my Body Makeup and wanted me to come over to help cover her veins. North & I went straight to her house & showed her exactly how to use it & I love how happy she is with the results! Swipe to see how amazing this before and after is on MJ! Let’s talk about the transfer. I’ve been using body makeup for over a decade now and in my experience you either get coverage that doesn’t transfer but it’s super dry and looks fake or its the opposite and really moisturizing but completely transfers. My new Body Makeup is in between. If you let it dry before putting your clothes on it transfers way less and if you set it with a translucent powder it hardly transfers at all. It was important to keep the skin looking flawless yet natural. Swipe to the 3rd slide to see. In the transfer video we didn’t have translucent powder but tried one of my pressed powders and that worked pretty good too! My body foundation really evens out and corrects your skin tone and conceals veins and bruises. My formula is super creamy, hydrating and long lasting! I can’t wait for you guys to try the entire Body Collection launching in two days on Friday, 06.21 at 12pm pst at kkwbeauty.com "

The second to last video is me using the shade Pearl! The powder also helps set the liquid body makeup and shimmer if you are layering all 3 products together. Launching to this Friday, 06.21 at 12pm pst at kkwbeauty.com "

"My new Liquid Body Shimmer comes in pearl, gold and bronze shades. You can use the shimmer alone or layer it with the Body Makeup to give yourself an extra glow.

"I’m so excited for you guys to try my new Body Collection. It consists of 3 different products (body make up, a liquid body shimmer and a loose shimmer powder). I use them all separately and sometimes all together depending on the look I am going for. This one shown above is the body Make Up. This is what I use most often. I don’t always like my legs to have shimmer on them. I use this when I want to enhance my skin tone or cover my psoriasis. I bruise easily and have veins and this has been my secret for over a decade. I’ve learned to live with and not be insecure of my psoriasis, but for days when I want to just cover it up I use this Body Makeup. My formula is so creamy and buildable and has a smooth satin finish. It builds easily for a more full coverage if needed. It launches 06.21.19 at 12pm pst at kkwbeauty.com Stay tuned for some videos showing how i use it all. "

A little behind the scenes from our wedding day 5 years ago 📷
This was my wedding day almost 5 years ago in Italy. We flew in from Paris and our glam was rushed as we were trying to make it on time! We barely got my veil in as I was being pushed out the door so fast to walk down the aisle because Andrea Bocelli had started singing and I couldn’t miss it. I had no idea it was really him until I got to the isle and screamed inside! So many amazing memories.

COACHELLA 2019. Sunday Service was so special to experience here at Coachella especially for my first time here! Kanye started Sunday Service for healing for himself and his close friends and family.

"Last year I registered with the California State Bar to study law. For the next 4 years, a minimum of 18 hours a week is required, I will take written and multiple choice tests monthly. As my first year is almost coming to an end I am preparing for the baby bar, a mini version of the bar, which is required when studying law this way. I’ve seen some comments from people who are saying it’s my privilege or my money that got me here, but that’s not the case. One person actually said I should “stay in my lane.” I want people to understand that there is nothing that should limit your pursuit of your dreams, and the accomplishment of new goals. You can create your own lanes, just as I am. The state bar doesn’t care who you are. This option is available to anyone who’s state allows it. It’s true I did not finish college. You need 60 college credits (I had 75) to take part in “reading the law”, which is an in office law school being apprenticed by lawyers. For anyone assuming this is the easy way out, it’s not. My weekends are spent away from my kids while I read and study. I work all day, put my kids to bed and spend my nights studying. There are times I feel overwhelmed and when I feel like I can’t do it but I get the pep talks I need from the people around me supporting me. I changed my number last year and disconnected from everyone because I have made this strict commitment to follow a dream of mine - It’s never too late to follow your dreams. I want to thank Van Jones for believing in me and introducing me to Jessica Jackson. Jessica along with Erin Haney have taken on the role of my mentors and I am forever grateful to them both putting in so much time with me, believing in me and supporting me through this journey. This week I have a big torts essay due on negligence. Wish me luck ✨⚖️ "
There won’t be an episode of KUWTK on tonight but next weeks episode shows our Halloween shoot as angels. Any suggestions of what me and my sisters can be this year?
My baby True. Happy 1st Birthday!!! You are so special. I couldn’t have dreamed of a better best friend for you than your cousin Chi ✨ Seeing how close you are is exactly how mom & I are and so we know how much fun you guys are going to have!

"For the last year, I have immersed myself in learning about the criminal justice system. I visited prisons, met with formerly incarcerated people, and helped with cases of individual injustice - including two death penalty cases. I have met with and am very supportive of Governor Newsom and his decision to help bring an end to the California Death Penalty. Racial bias and unfairness run deep throughout the justice system but especially when it comes to the death penalty. And we should not be okay with the risk that an innocent person could be executed. I hope we can turn toward better solutions that focus more on healing victims of trauma and prioritizing fairness and justice. "

Shout out to my trainer who really changed my body. When I wasn’t happy with what I saw back in the mirror I spent a whole year training so hard 5 or 6 days a week putting in a lot of work and changed the way that I eat and there’s such a noticeable difference. I am firm and less cellulite and so much more confident. SO THANK YOU for waking up at 5am to do crazy body building workouts & sprints that I hate 😜& putting me on to this lifestyle

What an amazing day yesterday to take my daughter to Washington DC to see our future leaders speak. Having my daughter march along-side her grandfather and parents was a day I hope she remembers forever. I know that the younger generation will vote to change these gun laws that so desperately need to be changed. Hearing these stories yesterday and meeting so many families affected by gun violence was heart breaking and I hope when it comes time to vote we all step up and vote to protect our children.

You guys don’t even understand my love for this woman . When I was 8 years old Allison & I watched her shoot her Cherish music video in Malibu on the beach shot by Herb Ritz. In 1989 She was also my neighbor & gave Kourtney & I a box of neon jewelry & black rubber bracelets. We went to school bragging hard but no one believed us! I’ve looked up to her always & now I get the best skin care advice from her! Obsessed with rose mist & the eye mask OMG it’s the best. Can’t wait for you to watch our intimate chat on YouTube Follow for all of the details

"Powder Contour & Highlight Kits dropping next week! If I could only have one thing in my makeup bag, it would be my powder kit! There are two matte contour shades and two shimmer highlight shades in each palette and a new dual-ended brush with an angled side for contour and a round side for highlight. Plus each palette comes with a built in mirror. I'll use the lighter shade as a bronzer to warm up my face and the darker shade to contour and define. And the highlighters give the prettiest glow! I usually use the medium kit when I'm tan, and the light when I'm pale. Launching 08.22 on KKWBEAUTY.COM "

"Tonight's episode is going to be very tough for me. However, I thought it was important to share this story through my eyes & not in an interview where my own words could be twisted. I have always shared so much & I'm not going to hold back when this was probably one of the most life changing experiences for me. I would never wish this experience upon anyone, but have learned some valuable lessons & feel so blessed to be safe home with my babies & husband. To my friends, family, and loved ones I can't thank you enough for being there when I needed you the most.

"I guess you saw the attention my last post received. The FDA has told Duchesnay, Inc., that my last post about Diclegis (doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine HCl) was incomplete because it did not include any risk information or important limitations of use for Diclegis. A link to this information accompanied the post, but this didn’t meet FDA requirements. So, I’m re-posting and sharing this important information about Diclegis. For US Residents Only. Diclegis is a prescription medicine used to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in women who have not improved with change in diet or other non-medicine treatments. Limitation of Use: Diclegis has not been studied in women with hyperemesis gravidarum. Important Safety Information Do not take Diclegis if you are allergic to doxylamine succinate, other ethanolamine derivative antihistamines, pyridoxine hydrochloride or any of the ingredients in Diclegis. You should also not take Diclegis in combination with medicines called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), as these medicines can intensify and prolong the adverse CNS effects of Diclegis. The most common side effect of Diclegis is drowsiness. Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or other activities that need your full attention unless your healthcare provider says that you may do so. Do not drink alcohol, or take other central nervous system depressants such as cough and cold medicines, certain pain medicines, and medicines that help you sleep while you take Diclegis. Severe drowsiness can happen or become worse causing falls or accidents. Tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Diclegis can pass into your breast milk and may harm your baby. You should not breastfeed while using Diclegis. Additional safety information can be found at www.DiclegisImportantSafetyinfo.com or www.Diclegis.com. Duchesnay USA encourages you to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088. "

"First they said I'm too skinny so I have to be faking it...Now they say I'm too big so I have to be faking it...SMH! Some days I'm photographed before I eat & look smaller, some days I've just eaten & I look bigger. It's all a part of the process. I think you all know me well enough to know I would document the process if I got a surrogate. Everyone's body is different, every pregnancy is very different! I've learned to love my body at every stage! I'm going to get even bigger & that's beautiful too! I'm blessed to even be pregnant & even luckier to not have preeclampsia as far as I know, so I don't have the swelling issue this time! They also say your body carries a boy different than a girl! Whatever the case may be I'm grateful to God for this miracle & no matter what rumors or comments you throw my way this time they truly don't affect me! 😜 "

"Today marks the 100 year anniversary of Armenian Genocide! I am proud to now say I have been to Armenia. I have seen the memorials and the people who survived and I am so proud of how strong the Armenian people are!

But proud of the fact that I see change and am happy many people have started to recognize this genocide! We won't give up, we will be recognized by all soon! ♦️🔷🔶 "

"I don't post this to prove anything, or to try and make people believe I love my wife, I simply think it's an honoring thing to do, publicly acknowledging your significant other! Its like we're all okay with acknowledging an achievement or award, but think there has to be something shady about saying something publicly about the one you love. I have nothing to prove by saying I love my wife. I just think there is power in putting ur wife on a pedestal! I like to make my wife feel special and valued, Ive done a lot of cool things but I dont think anything comes close to as cool as that "

"Hey Taylor. First of all i would like to apologize for posting that hurtful instagram post, at the time i thought it was funny but looking back it was distasteful and insensitive.. I have to be honest though it was my caption and post that I screenshoted of scooter and Kanye that said “taylor swift what up” he didnt have anything to do with it and it wasnt even a part of the conversation in all actuality he was the person who told me not to joke like that.. Scooter has had your back since the days you graciously let me open up for you.! As the years have passed we haven’t crossed paths and gotten to communicate our differences, hurts or frustrations. So for you to take it to social media and get people to hate on scooter isn’t fair. What were you trying to accomplish by posting that blog? seems to me like it was to get sympathy u also knew that in posting that your fans would go and bully scooter. Anyway, One thing i know is both scooter and i love you. I feel like the only way to resolve conflict is through communication. So banter back and fourth online i dont believe solves anything. I’m sure Scooter and i would love to talk to you and resolve any conflict, pain or or any feelings that need to be addressed. Neither scooter or i have anything negative to say about you we truly want the best for you. I usually don’t rebuttal things like this but when you try and deface someone i loves character thats crossing a line.. "
These are the moments I live for.. alone time with you refreshes my soul. You are so out of my league and I’m okay with that! You are mine and I am yours

"everyone wants to wait til people die To give them the credit they deserve. I’m calling it now when CB passes away after a long full life, you will miss what you had in front of you the whole time ... trust me watch you will see. the people who have over looked this mans talent ... you need to reevaluate! Love you "
Don’t stop fighting the battle has already won.. fight for what you love and who you love don’t let fear and anxiety win..god has not given us a spirit of fear but of power love and of a sound mind! I havent believed the truth about myself I haven’t believed I am loved I haven’t believed I am forgiven it’s a hard thing for me to wrap my head around. I hang my head in shame and I wallow in sadnes about the the people who have betrayed me. Jesus has given me freedom and the persuit of getting to know his character is never ending. Gods character never changes he is the same yesterday now and forever. He is always good!. I won’t be afraid to be vulnerable before him.. his power is made strong in our weakness. God isn’t afraid of your pain and your brokenness he actually welcomes it. Come to me all who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest! these are words from Jesus! There is hope and it’s in him.!! He loves and cares for you! For god so loved the world that he gave his only son so that whoever believes him wont die but have eternal life! You are that whoever and he accepts you as you are!! He loves and forgives you and welcomes you into his arms every time you mess He is a perfect and loving god who adores you!

Walt Disney and Apostle Paul.
Laura Ingraham absolutely disgusting what you did on national television. How dare you laugh in the face of a person who has passed on. Doesn’t matter who it is. But disrespecting someone’s who was a pillar in the community and did right by people? Did you not think about the family who just lost a love one and now have to see you mock him on national television It’s absurd and you should be fired period.

"Sunlight falls into the Abyss Just like i fall into your lips Waves crash onto the shore My love for you grows more and more Sound of the crickets a true meditation I think about you, Gods greatest creation. As i fall into this blissful state I ponder on how you’re my one true SOULMATE Its getting dark to dark to see A chilling breeze embraces me The smell of camomile fresh from the garden My life is a movie that both of us star in. Speaking of stars I’m starting to see some They light up the sky, reminds me of my freedom How big and how vast our world is around us So grateful for god we were lost but he found us So i write the poem with him always in mind Things all around us Just get better with time. I fall more in love with you every day! You have walked hand and hand with me as I continue to get my emotions, mind, body and soul in tact! You have given me so much strength, support , encouragement and joy. I just wanted to publicly honor you, and remind you that the best is yet to come! Have a great shoot today my love! "

Missed your bday bro sorry happy late bday
"Happy birthday mama You are appreciated When I was young, me and my mama had beef Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool With the big boys breakin' all the rules "
"There’s always gonna be people offended, there’s also people who don’t take jokes very well, I am a prankster and it was APRIL FOOLS. I didn’t at all mean to be insensitive to people who can’t have children. A lot of people I know, their first go to prank on April fools is telling their parents they are pregnant to get a big reaction. But I will apologize anyway and take responsibility and say sorry to people who were offended. I truly don’t want anyone to be hurt by a prank.. it’s like when I shoved cake in my little sisters face for her birthday expecting her to laugh but she cried. You sometimes just don’t know what will hurt someone’s feelings not to compare pregnancy with cake in the face but it’s just to paint the picture of not knowing what will offend. Some might have laughed but some were offended .. I think With pranks u sometimes have to roll that dice. "

"So I read a lot of messages saying you want an album .. I’ve toured my whole teenage life, and early 20s, I realized and as you guys probably saw I was unhappy last tour and I don’t deserve that and you don’t deserve that, you pay money to come and have a lively energetic fun light concert and I was unable emotionally to give you that near the end of the tour. I have been looking, seeking, trial and error as most of us do, I am now very focused on repairing some of the deep rooted issues that I have as most of us have, so that I don’t fall apart, so that I can sustain my marriage and be the father I want to be. Music is very important to me but Nothing comes before my family and my health. I will come with a kick ass album ASAP, my swag is undeniable and my drive is indescribable his love is supernatural his grace is that reliable.... the top is where I reside period whether I make music or not the king said so. 👑 but I will come with a vengeance believe that.. (grammar and punctuation will be terrible pretend it’s a text where u just don’t care). "

The thing I am most excited for is that my little brother and sister get to see another healthy stable marriage and look for the same!!! Gods timing really is literally perfect, we got engaged on the seventh day of the seventh month, the number seven is the number of spiritual perfection, it’s true GOOGLE IT! Isn’t that nuts?

The picture to the right is not a photo I drew this perfect masterpiece in only 7 minutes I know it looks like I must have spent days even months but know this beautiful art piece only took minutes. The strokes that I used while drawing this were tough but nothing amazing comes easy.. This piece will go for 2 mil at least
There was nothing that I could do

"I don't know about these award shows.. No disrespect to anybody at any of the shows or the people running it. Nothing but love for you guys and your support. But I don't feel good when I'm there nor after. I try to think of it as a celebration but can't help feeling like people are rating and grading my performance. A lot of people in the audience there to be seem worried about how much camera time they will get or who they can network with. When I'm doing a regular show I feel they are there for the right reasons and to strictly have a good time! But these award shows seem so hollow. I get the premise is to award people for their accomplishments, but is it really? Because when I look in the audience I see a bunch of fake smiles so that when the camera hits them they look happy. Sure there are people truly proud of others so I don't want to knock them I'm just looking at the vast majority. I just think to myself if I'm living my purpose I want the reward to be fulfillment. I'm getting awarded for the things that I'm doing and not for who I am which is understandable I know it would probably be hard to calculate and award someone's spirit lol. But When I do get these awards the temptation of putting my worth in what I do is so hard to fight!!!I am privileged and honored to be recognized by my peers in but in these settings I can't feel the recognition. There's an authenticity missing that I crave! And I wonder does anybody else.. Sorry not sorry about grammar it's not my strong point "

Braekess you are so right btw your Instagram name is fire. Years ago it was impossible to even take a picture at anytime not everyone was accessible to a camera now everyone has a camera phone and Now it's just a different thing.If you think setting boundaries is being a douche I'm the biggest douche around but I think it's smart and will be the only way I last. I wanna enjoy life and not be a slave to the world and their demands of what they think I need to do!! I love the fact that I am able to make people happy but cmon if you truly were in my position you would understand how tiring it is ( boo hoo Justin get over it) I'm going to keep making decisions I feel are fit for my growth and no human being will make me feel bad for it.


Eyes are the window to the soul

Thank you philly I took this haha not that sick but good for me ;) and I mean the picture not the city

The calm before the storm
"These nights are with you not for you !!! I am with you, we are in this together!thank you for the encouragement I'm sending it right back your way! "

Would love to talk about this because it's another moment to point to God. When I said on the 7th day it was a reference to say that on the 7th day he rested giving us a template and example letting us know how important rest is. People love to twist what was meant for good and maybe it was my fault by not explaining my thought correctly. You can think the worst about me but never ever want people to think I compare myself to The MOST HIGH





"And on the 7th day..... AND MY GOODNESS I WAS MAKING A REFERENCE, I AM NOT COMPARING MYSELF TO GOD IM THE FARTHEST THING FROM!!!! IT WAS MY WAY OF SAYING HOW IMPORTANT REST IS.. WHEN THERE IS NOTHING TO PICK AT ME FOR YOU MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF NOTHING BUT I GET IT YOU NEED RATINGS AND TRACTION YOUR BLOGS. But if truthfully if you were offended it was in no way shape or form me comparing myself to the most high. "

"Love u guys.. I'm going to be canceling my meet and greets. I enjoy meeting such incredible people but I end up feeling so drained and filled with so much of other people's spiritual energy that I end up so drained and unhappy.. Want to make people smile and happy but not at my expense and I always leave feeling mentally and emotionally exhausted to the point of depression .. The pressure of meeting people's expectations of what I'm supposed to be is so much for me to handle and a lot on my shoulders. Never want to disappoint but I feel I would rather give you guys the show and my albums as promised. Can't tell you how sorry I am, and wish it wasn't so hard on me.. And I want to stay in the healthy mindset I'm in to give you the best show you have ever seen ;) "

Challenge yourself even if it is a stupid little sudoku, or if you aren't challenged creatively try and write poems, or a story. "

"Sadly it's Been a rough week for me, long days no sleep, while having to be ""on"" as they would say for cameras fans etc. In no way did I mean to come across mean, but chose to end the show as the people in the front row would not listen. Hopefully people will understand where I am coming from. I don't always handle things the right way but I'm human and I'm working on getting better at responding not reacting. Unfortunately people were affected by this as am I. For the people in the back I am so sorry and for anyone I may have disappointed im sorry. Sorry for wasting the tv people's time I'll be sure to make it up to you next time on tour.. With love Justin. "

"Vindicate me, my god, and plead my cause against an unfaithful nation. Rescue me from those who are deceitful and wicked. - Psalms 43 I'm not religious nor do i think I have ANYTHING figured out that's why I call out on God to help me through what I can't do on my own. Developing my relationship with God has been the coolest thing I've experienced, to know that I'm not alone and I don't have to live in fear. Never feel like I'm pushing anything on u but sharing the good news I've felt in my own life. "

My view
;)
This is what it's all about !!! L.O.V.3
"Everyone in my team has been telling me, ""keep the press happy"" but I'm tired of all the countless lies in the press right now. Saying I'm going to rehab and how my family is disappointed in me. My family is beyond proud, and nothing's been said by them, my grandparents wouldnt know how to reach to press even of they did want to so that was a lie and rehab cmon. if Anyone believes i need rehab thats their own stupidity lol I'm 19 with 5 number one albums, 19 and I've seen the whole world. 19 and I've accomplished more than I could've ever dreamed of, i'm 19 and it must be scary to some people to think that this is just the beginning. I know my talent level and i know i got my head on straight. i know who i am and i know who i'm not My messege is to to believe. My albums could be about anything but my messages have been to never say never and believe, not to believe in me but to believe in yourself .. I honestly don't care if you don't believe in me because I believe in me, my friends believe, my family believe, my fans believe, and look where that's gotten me so far.. I'm writing this with a smile on my face and love in my heart. Letting u know first hand how I feel rather than have these story linger. I'm a good person with a big heart. And don't think I deserve all this negative press I've worked my ass off to get where I am and my hard work doesn't stop here... All this isn't easy. I get angry sometimes. I'm human. I'm gonna make mistakes. In gonna grow and get better from them. But all the love from you guys overcomes the negativity. I love u. Thanks "

"The funny moment when people believe I brought underage people to a club.. U think Will is letting his 14 year old in a club, I don't think so.. 2nd I love how the club wanted to give the press another reason to why we didn't stay at their weak ass club so they wouldn't look bad for me walking in and right back out..i said m ""worst bday"" but that was due to dummies pushing over my fans and being overly aggressive. Btw it wasn't the worst bday cuz all my friends from back home flew in I was just mad in the moment "

"🌈HAPPY PRIDE MONTH!!!🌈 While we have so much to celebrate, we also have a great distance to go before everyone in this country is truly treated equally. In excellent recent news, the House has passed the Equality Act, which would protect LGBTQ people from discrimination in their places of work, homes, schools, and other public accommodations. The next step is that the bill will go before the Senate. I’ve decided to kick off Pride Month by writing a letter to one of my senators to explain how strongly I feel that the Equality Act should be passed. I urge you to write to your senators too. I’ll be looking for your letters by searching the hashtag While there’s no information yet as to when the Equality Act will go before the Senate for a vote, we do know this: Politicians need votes to stay in office. Votes come from the people. Pressure from massive amounts of people is a major way to push politicians towards positive change. That’s why I’ve created a petition at change.org to urge the Senate to support the Equality Act. Our country’s lack of protection for its own citizens ensures that LGBTQ people must live in fear that their lives could be turned upside down by an employer or landlord who is homophobic or transphobic. The fact that, legally, some people are completely at the mercy of the hatred and bigotry of others is disgusting and unacceptable. Let’s show our pride by demanding that, on a national level, our laws truly treat all of our citizens equally. 🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈 Click the link in my bio to sign the petition for Senate support of the Equality Act.

You have made this human disco ball so so happy tonight. ❤️ 📸:
"I’m writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November 6th, in which I’ll be voting in the state of Tennessee. In the past I’ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country. I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent. I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love. Running for Senate in the state of Tennessee is a woman named Marsha Blackburn. As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me. She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values. I will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives. Please, please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values. For a lot of us, we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100% on every issue, but we have to vote anyway. So many intelligent, thoughtful, self-possessed people have turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count. But first you need to register, which is quick and easy to do. October 9th is the LAST DAY to register to vote in the state of TN. Go to vote.org and you can find all the info. Happy Voting! 🗳😃🌈 "

"While there are much bigger problems happening in the world, suffering from acne for me was debilitating. It’s something that I’ve dealt with since I was a young teen and has caused me to feel anxious, helpless and insecure. As humans, I don’t think we share our insecurities enough because we live in a time where being “perfect” is the standard. We curate our life online and pick the pretty moments to post. I’d like to show a younger generation that not everything is perfect. Being insecure about my acne gave me thick skin but I wouldn’t ever wish that feeling upon anyone so after trying countless options, I found something that has been helpful in maintaining clear skin for me. It’s been a long journey but I’m excited for where my skin is now. I didn’t think I’d see the day where I would feel confident posting a makeup free picture. My goal is to open up a dialogue around skin positivity. ❤️ "
